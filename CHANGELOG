- Add Python 3.12 to build matrix

No code changes.

## v4.0 [Breaking Changes]

The library now asks for which Django cache configuraiton to use rather
than requiring it's own entry in Django's CACHES setting. This means you
can take advantage of an existing cache and any features you have set up
with it such as connection pooling.

If you wish to continue as you were before without modifying your Django
Cache configuration, then set the new setting to:

```
GEOIP2_EXTRAS_CACHE_NAME = "geoip2-extras"
```

As you would already have the `geoip2-extras` cache configuration set up
from previously using this library.

## v3.0 [Breaking Changes]

* Add support for Python 3.11
* Drop support for Python 3.7
* Add support for Django 4.0, 4.1
* Drop support for Django 2.2, 3.0, 3.1
